# CS350Emerging-Systems-Architectures-Technologies

•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I’ve uploaded two project artifacts, both designed for the TI CC3220SF LaunchXL board.

SOS Blinking Lights Project:

This project involved creating an 'SOS' message in Morse code using the LED and a synchronous state machine. It features an interrupt activated by a button press, changing the Morse code message to 'OK'.

Smart Thermostat Prototype:

This project is a prototype for a smart thermostat that utilizes I2C, GPIO, and UART peripherals. It reads the temperature sensor, controls the LED, and outputs data to a console (simulating data being sent to a server). It also includes an interrupt to adjust the setpoint when buttons are pressed.

•	What did you do particularly well?
The code worked well for both projects.  They performed according to the requirements.

•	Where could you improve?
While I am content with the state machine diagrams that I created for each project, this is an area where I’m open to learning better ways to design them.  The SOS project has a very detailed state machine diagram which possibly could be simplified.

•	What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I gained experience using Code Composer Studio, including hands-on debugging of the board.

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I developed C programming skills through these projects, which I am confident will be applicable to future projects.

•	How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I adhered to coding guidelines to ensure the projects are maintainable and readable. The code is modular, making it easy to modify or reuse in other projects.
